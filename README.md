Unsupervised thermal phase diagram of quantum XXZ model with anomaly detection and autoencoder techniques.

We consider:
1. Finite temperature the phase diagram of the quantum XXZ Heisenberg model in the presence of a transverse field.
2. Dimensionality reduction techniques, namely PCA and t-SNE, to investigate distinct quantum phases in the model.
3. Anomaly detection with autoencoder for phase boundary discovery
